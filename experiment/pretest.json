        },
        "explanations": {
          "a": "Explanation: An instrumentation amplifier has high input resistance, which prevents loading of the signal source.",
          "b": "Explanation: Instrumentation amplifiers are designed to have low noise to provide a clean amplified signal.",
          "c": "Explanation: Instrumentation amplifiers have high Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) to reject common-mode signals effectively.",
          "d": "Explanation: All of the above characteristics (High input resistance, Low noise, High CMRR) are true for an instrumentation amplifier."

          "a": "What instrument is used to amplify the output signal of transducer",
          "b": "Instrumentation amplifier",
          "c": "Differential amplifier",
          "d": "Bridge amplifier"
        },
        "explanations": {
          "a": "Explanation: This option doesn't correctly answer the question.",
          "b": "Explanation: An instrumentation amplifier is designed to amplify the output signal of a transducer, especially when the signal is weak and differential.",
          "c": "Explanation: A differential amplifier amplifies the difference between two input signals, but it is not specifically designed for transducer outputs.",
          "d": "Explanation: A bridge amplifier is often used in applications like strain gauges, but it doesn't amplify transducer signals as effectively as an instrumentation amplifier."

        "question": "3. What is the primary purpose of an instrumentation amplifier?",
        "answers": {
          "a": "To amplify low-level differential signals",
          "b": "To provide high power output",
          "c": "To act as a voltage regulator",
          "d": "To operate as a comparator"
        },
        "explanations": {
          "a": "Explanation: The primary purpose of an instrumentation amplifier is to amplify low-level differential signals, especially in situations with high common-mode noise.",
          "b": "Explanation: While an instrumentation amplifier amplifies signals, it is not primarily designed to provide high power output.",
          "c": "Explanation: Instrumentation amplifiers do not regulate voltage, so they are not used as voltage regulators.",
          "d": "Explanation: Instrumentation amplifiers are not comparators. They are designed to amplify signals, not to compare them."

        "question": "4. The common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of an instrumentation amplifier should ideally be:",
        "answers": {
          "a": "High",
          "b": "Low",
          "c": "Zero",
          "d": "Infinite"
        },
        "explanations": {
          "a": "Explanation: The CMRR should ideally be high to reject common-mode signals and focus on the differential signals, which is the main purpose of an instrumentation amplifier.",
          "b": "Explanation: A low CMRR would mean that the amplifier cannot reject common-mode signals effectively.",
          "c": "Explanation: A CMRR of zero would mean no rejection of common-mode signals, which is not ideal for an instrumentation amplifier.",
          "d": "Explanation: While an infinite CMRR is theoretically ideal, it is not practical. However, a very high CMRR is the desired specification."
