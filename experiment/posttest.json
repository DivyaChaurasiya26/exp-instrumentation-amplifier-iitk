        "question": "1. Which of the following characteristics is NOT desirable for the DC amplifier?",
        "answers": {
          "a": "Low common mode rejection ratio",
          "b": "High input impedance",
          "c": "Good thermal and long term stability",
          "d": "Balanced differential inputs"
        },
        "explanations": {
          "a": "Explanation: A low common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) means the amplifier can't effectively reject noise common to both inputs, which is undesirable for DC amplifiers.",
          "b": "Explanation: High input impedance is desirable in DC amplifiers to prevent loading the source.",
          "c": "Explanation: Good thermal and long-term stability ensure the amplifier performs reliably over time.",
          "d": "Explanation: Balanced differential inputs help in rejecting common-mode signals and are desirable in DC amplifier design."

        "answers": {
          "a": "Instrumentation amplifier",
          "b": "Differential instrumentation amplifier",
          "c": "Inverting instrumentation amplifier",
          "d": "Non-inverting instrumentation amplifier"
        },
        "explanations": {
          "a": "Explanation: Instrumentation amplifiers can be built using general purpose op-amps, but more precise configurations are often preferred.",
          "b": "Explanation: Differential instrumentation amplifiers are commonly implemented using general-purpose op-amps for measuring small differential voltages.",
          "c": "Explanation: Inverting instrumentation amplifiers are not typically the default application for general purpose op-amps.",
          "d": "Explanation: Non-inverting instrumentation amplifiers may use general op-amps but are typically tailored for specific gains and noise requirements."
